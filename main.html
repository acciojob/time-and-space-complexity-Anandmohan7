    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n).</p>
